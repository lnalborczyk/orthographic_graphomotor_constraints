	abstract = {Over the last four decades, sequential accumulation models for choice response times have spread through cognitive psychology like wildfire. The most popular style of accumulator model is the diffusion model (Ratcliff Psychological Review, 85, 59–108, ), which has been shown to account for data from a wide range of paradigms, including perceptual discrimination, letter identification, lexical decision, recognition memory, and signal detection. Since its original inception, the model has become increasingly complex in order to account for subtle, but reliable, data patterns. The additional complexity of the diffusion model renders it a tool that is only for experts. In response, Wagenmakers et al. (Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review, 14, 3–22, ) proposed that researchers could use a more basic version of the diffusion model, the {EZ} diffusion. Here, we simulate experimental effects on data generated from the full diffusion model and compare the power of the full diffusion model and {EZ} diffusion to detect those effects. We show that the {EZ} diffusion model, by virtue of its relative simplicity, will be sometimes better able to detect experimental effects than the data–generating full diffusion model.},

	abstract = {The {EZ}-diffusion model for two-choice response time tasks takes mean response time, the variance of response time, and response accuracy as inputs. The model transforms these data via three simple equations to produce unique values for the quality of information, response conservativeness, and nondecision time. This transformation of observed data in terms of unobserved variables addresses the speed—accuracy trade-off and allows an unambiguous quantification of performance differences in two-choice response time tasks. The {EZ}-diffusion model can be applied to data-sparse situations to facilitate individual subject analysis. We studied the performance of the {EZ}-diffusion model in terms of parameter recovery and robustness against misspecification by using Monte Carlo simulations. The {EZ} model was also applied to a real-world data set.},

	abstract = {In the ﬁeld of cognitive psychology, the p-value hypothesis test has established a stranglehold on statistical reporting. This is unfortunate, as the p-value provides at best a rough estimate of the evidence that the data provide for the presence of an experimental effect. An alternative and arguably more appropriate measure of evidence is conveyed by a Bayesian hypothesis test, which prefers the model with the highest average likelihood. One of the main problems with this Bayesian hypothesis test, however, is that it often requires relatively sophisticated numerical methods for its computation. Here we draw attention to the Savage–Dickey density ratio method, a method that can be used to compute the result of a Bayesian hypothesis test for nested models and under certain plausible restrictions on the parameter priors. Practical examples demonstrate the method’s validity, generality, and ﬂexibility.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Bayesian multilevel models are increasingly used to overcome the limitations of frequentist approaches in the analysis of complex structured data. This paper introduces Bayesian multilevel modelling for the speciﬁc analysis of speech data, using the brms package developed in R. Method: In this tutorial, we provide a practical introduction to Bayesian multilevel modelling, by reanalysing a phonetic dataset containing formant (F1 and F2) values for ﬁve vowels of Standard Indonesian ({ISO} 639-3:ind), as spoken by eight speakers (four females), with several repetitions of each vowel. Results: We ﬁrst give an introductory overview of the Bayesian framework and multilevel modelling. We then show how Bayesian multilevel models can be ﬁtted using the probabilistic programming language Stan and the R package brms, which provides an intuitive formula syntax. Conclusions: Through this tutorial, we demonstrate some of the advantages of the Bayesian framework for statistical modelling and provide a detailed case study, with complete source code for full reproducibility of the analyses (https://osf.io/dpzcb/).},

In the cognitive neurosciences, the diffusion decision model has recently been adopted as a quantitative tool to study the neural basis of decision making under time pressure.

	abstract = {The Ratcliff diffusion model for simple two-choice decisions (e.g., Ratcliff, 1978; Ratcliff \& {McKoon}, 2008) has two outstanding advantages. First, the model generally provides an excellent fit to the observed data (i.e., response accuracy and the shape of {RT} distributions, both for correct and error responses). Second, the parameters of the model can be mapped on to latent psychological processes such as the speed of information accumulation, response caution, and a priori bias. In recent years, the advantages of the Ratcliff diffusion model have become increasingly clear. Current advances in methodology allow all researchers to fit the diffusion model to data easily. Recent applications to ageing, lexical decision, {IQ}, practice, the implicit association test, and the accessory stimulus effect serve to highlight the added value of a diffusion model perspective on simple decision making.},

	abstract = {The Bayesian approach to data analysis provides a powerful way to handle uncertainty in all observations, model parameters, and model structure using probability theory. Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

	abstract = {Count data is prevalent in many different areas of linguistics, such as when counting words, syntactic constructions, discourse particles, case markers, or speech errors. The Poisson distribution is the canonical distribution for characterizing count data with no or unknown upper bound. Whereas logistic regression is very common in linguistics, Poisson regression is little known. This tutorial introduces readers to foundational concepts needed for Poisson regression, followed by a hands-on tutorial using the R package brms. We discuss a dataset where Catalan and Korean speakers change the frequency of their co-speech gestures as a function of politeness contexts. This dataset also involves exposure variables (the incorporation of time to deal with unequal intervals) and overdispersion (excess variance). Altogether, we hope that more linguists will consider Poisson regression for the analysis of count data.},
